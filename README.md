### What is this account?

This account is for things I don't want to put on my main account. These are projects that I started but don't think are good enough.

### Why is this account here then?

Github counts contributions by commits. If a repository is deleted then commits are gone too. That would be a significant amount of commits gone if I were to delete those repositories. Hence this account as a "buffer".
