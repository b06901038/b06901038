### What is this account?

This account is for things I don't want to put on my main account. These are projects that I started but don't think are good enough. Perhaps this account should be renamed **rentruewang-archive**?

### Why is this account here then?

Github counts contributions by commits. If a repository is deleted then commits are gone too. That would be a significant amount of commits gone if I were to delete those repositories. This account acts as a archive that stores code I no longer want on my main, while retaining the commit count.
